The idea was to build a dashboard for users of a trading platform. I created mobile responsive interactive front-end with React and React for styling. I also incorporated pagination into react. Users can be added and deleted or edited. Faker API was used for generating all the user data.Openweather API was used for the front-end weather widget and the Alpha Advantage API was used for day-wise prices of tesla stock. The React-plotly.js library was used for plotting stock prices.
A mock backend without data persistence with time interval of 3 seconds to render responses.
